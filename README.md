# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of PyberAnaysis

We set out to provide an analysis of Pyber ride share service's over a 4 month period. We analyzed two data files, the first was the ride data file which kept track of the city name, date, cost of the fare, and the far ID. The second file we analyzed was the city data file that documented city name, city type, and driver count for the city. After merging these data files we were able to report many different data points that could be used to make strategic organizational decisions; key metrics like average fare per City type, average fare per driver, total fares per city type, total drivers per type.





## Results of the Analysis
As mentioned we started by merging the two data files into a single dataframe so we can analyze the data as a single dataframe.
